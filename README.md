# mergeSort
/*A Java program implementing the Merge Sort algorithm using input arrays and a deduplication method to return a numerically sorted array with no duplicate values.
The program implements the Merge Sort function in a way that solves O(nlog2(n) time complexity and O(n) space complexity. Input array is already given;however, this program should work for empty arrays,single variable arrays, and unsorted arrays alike. Then, after sorting the input array, the program implements a deduplication method which adheres to a O(n) time and O(1) space complexity utilizing a basic linear search algorithm. */
